As the name suggest, it can be used for taking notes or like a diary.
This Web-App has different feature:
1. Add note button: to simply add a new note.
2. On the Note, there is a Save and Delete Button.
----> When you click outside the note, it will save the state of the note
3. Auto-saving state, when someone deletes a note.
4. An empty note is added when you fire the app for the first time.
Right now because i am learning frontend, I used local-storage of the browser to save the notes data and its state.
I also added some media query for adding responsiveness to this app.
